# Gen AI Chat App using Azure AI Foundry SDK
This project was developed as part of Module 3 of the Microsoft AI Skills Challenge: *Create agentic AI solutions with Azure AI Foundry*.
It demonstrates how to create a terminal-based generative AI chat application using the Azure AI Foundry SDK and a deployed OpenAI model.

## What I Learned
• How to use the Azure AI Foundry SDK in a Python project  
• How to connect to an Azure AI Project using `DefaultAzureCredential`  
• How to securely manage environment variables with `.env` and `python-dotenv`  
• How to create a chat client using the project’s inference endpoint  
• How to send messages to an OpenAI model and receive chat completions  
• How to handle user input and build a chat history in the terminal  

## Project Highlights
• Chat app runs in a loop and handles user prompts dynamically  
• Conversation context is preserved using prompt history  
• System prompt sets behavior of the assistant  
• Screenshots are included to demonstrate functionality and Azure setup
